**Customer Revenue Analysis Project: Leveraging Data to Drive Sales Growth**
As a recent graduate, I led a project for a small retail company analyzing customer revenue data to identify sales trends and growth opportunities. With the data already structured, I immediately delved into the analysis phase and used Tableau to create visualizations highlighting key patterns and trends in customer spending. My analysis focused on several areas, including revenue by state, revenue by month, revenue by age, quantity-discount percentage correlation, percentage of revenue by region, and revenue by category and gender.
Through my analysis, I discovered that the highest amount of revenue was generated in December 2020 and that customers between the ages of 30 and 40 were responsible for the majority of sales. Additionally, I observed a positive correlation between the quantity of items ordered and the discount percentage offered, with increased discount percentages leading to higher order quantities. I also found that sales value for mobile and tablet categories was higher among female customers compared to male customers. Based on the revenue share by region, the southern region contributed the highest percentage of revenue.
Using these insights, I developed targeted marketing campaign recommendations to increase sales. For example, I suggested offering special discounts to customers between the ages of 30 and 40, tailoring mobile and tablet category promotions to female customers, and prioritizing marketing efforts in the southern region.
